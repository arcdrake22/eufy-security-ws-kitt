/**
 * Keyless decoder for eufy `v2_eufysecurity:` event / thumbnail images.
 *
 * The v2 wire format is NOT end-to-end encrypted and needs NO key, cipher, or
 * E2E private key. It is *head-only obfuscation*: only a small JPEG prefix
 * (~280-430 bytes, length varies per image) is AES-GCM encrypted (SOI +
 * APP0/JFIF + the two DQT quantization tables + SOF dimensions + the first DHT
 * table). Everything from the standard baseline DC-chrominance Huffman table
 * marker (`FF C4 00 1F 01`) onward — the rest of the DHT, the SOS, the entire
 * entropy-coded scan and the EOI — is left as plaintext, standard baseline JPEG.
 *
 * So we reconstruct a viewable JPEG by splicing a freshly built *standard*
 * libjpeg header (correct width/height + chroma subsampling) onto the blob's
 * plaintext tail. The encrypted prefix only ever held the quantization tables
 * (=> a small quality/colour shift if we substitute standard q85 tables) and
 * the image dimensions (=> the only thing that must be pinned exactly).
 *
 * Wire format:  v2_eufysecurity:<SERIAL>:<10-digit-pkt>:<binary-ciphertext>
 *
 * Reverse-engineered 2026-06-04; verified on 136 live blobs across every camera
 * model / resolution under HomeBase 3. On 2026-06-10 the reconstruction was
 * cross-checked against the app's OWN decoded output (carved from the running
 * app's heap): the keyless splice matches it, and push thumbnails are 288x176
 * 4:2:0 (other sizes — 256x144, 640x360, 4:4:4 snapshots — also occur, so the
 * geometry is auto-detected rather than assumed; see decodeV2ImageAuto).
